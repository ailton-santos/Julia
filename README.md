# Julia Programing Language
## Prof. Ailton Dos Santos


For anyone starting in the world of programming with Julia, it's essential to master a set of core concepts that serve as the foundation of the language. 
We begin with:
- Conditional Structures, which allow your code to make decisions. 
- Loop Structures, crucial for automating repetitive tasks, 
- Processing data lists or executing a block of code multiple times,
- Functions are central to Julia's design for modularity and performance, 
- Arrays (including vectors and matrices) and 
- Dictionaries, are fundamental for organizing data collections efficiently.

While not strictly "Object-Oriented Programming" in the classical sense, Julia achieves many of the benefits through multiple dispatch and composite types. The ability to manage and use Packages (Julia's equivalent of modules/libraries) is a key differentiator, as it allows you to leverage a vast ecosystem of high-performance functionalities developed by others.
